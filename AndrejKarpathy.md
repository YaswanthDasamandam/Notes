# Andrej Karpathy's (Software in the Era of AI ) Notes.

1. **Software in the Era of AI** (Transformer Architecture)

2. **Software is changing again**

3. 
	1. Traditional 
	2. Neural Nets 
	3. AI-Generated Code

   * Map of GitHub
   * Hugging Face Model Atlas

   **AlexNet**

4. **New kind of computer** (New kind of code)

5. **Neural Nets are occupying the code site by eating through the code**
   (Each layer interacting )

6. **AI is the new Electricity** (Properties of Utility)

   * **FAB** also (CAPEX and R\&D)
   * Software is **malleable**

   ```
   CAPEX and OPEX  
   ┌────────┬───────┐  
   │ Train  │ Serve │  
   └────────┴───────┘  
   Intelligence becomes utility  
   ```

7. **LLM as Operating System** \[Very Early Stage]

8. **Cursors can host different LLMs**

9. **LLM compute is centralized (like time-sharing) → Moving toward personal LLMs**

10. **GUI is not yet reinvented (Chat is the new terminal)**

11. **LLM adoption: consumers are early, governments are lagging **

12. **LLMs simulate human-like spirits → Transformers (e.g., Rain Man Movie suggestion )**

13. **Hallucinations = Targeted Intelligence loss** (Anterograde amnesia)

14. **AI Security** (Idea)

15. **Partial Autonomy** (e.g., Cursor, content writing, orchestrators, app GUIs)

16. **Autonomy Slider **

17. **Generation + Verification (Make it fast) → People are the bottleneck**
    (Keep AI is the leash)

18. **Keep agents on a leash → Enables successful verification**

19. **An intermediate product called "Course" (which is auditable)**

20. **Iron Man Suit** (Building partial autonomy product)

21. Build For Agents. 

22. LLMs.txt file (In Markdown Format) 

23. Click -> cUrl , MCP 

24. gitingest, deepwiki 

25. Meeting LLMs in HalfWay
